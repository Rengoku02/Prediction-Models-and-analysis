### INTRODUCTION

In this study, we will examine a dataset including information on individuals with and without diabetes that was released by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. The objective here is to use the data to decide as to whether or not a certain patient suffers from diabetes. A thorough technique including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection and assessment, and interpretation will be used to accomplish this aim.

### Dataset Used

The "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" is the sample dataset, and it comprises details on 768 female patients of Pima Indian descent. UCI Machine Learning Repository now houses a dataset amassed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The purpose of this data collection is to use parameters like age, body mass index, and blood pressure to forecast the likelihood that a certain patient would acquire diabetes.

Outcome is a binary variable indicating whether or not the patient was diagnosed with diabetes, and it is used as a goal column. If the number is 1, then the patient did really get diabetes; otherwise, the value would be 0.

There are a total of 768 rows in the dataset, with each row representing a different patient. While the dataset as a whole has no missing values, there are a few feature columns with what seem to be impossible or missing values of 0. Since it is very improbable that a patient would have a blood pressure, skin thickness, or insulin level of 0, these values of 0 were probably utilized to represent missing data.
