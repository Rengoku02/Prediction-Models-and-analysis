### INTRODUCTION

In this study, we will examine a dataset including information on individuals with and without diabetes that was released by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. The objective here is to use the data to decide as to whether or not a certain patient suffers from diabetes. A thorough technique including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection and assessment, and interpretation will be used to accomplish this aim.

### Dataset Used

The "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" is the sample dataset, and it comprises details on 768 female patients of Pima Indian descent. UCI Machine Learning Repository now houses a dataset amassed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The purpose of this data collection is to use parameters like age, body mass index, and blood pressure to forecast the likelihood that a certain patient would acquire diabetes.
